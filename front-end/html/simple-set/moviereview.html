            M3gan 2.0 is the sequel to M3gan, that hit cinemas in June 2025. The movie is a science fiction that revolves around a robot with conflicting intentions and actions. The Robot's main purpose is to protect a young girl, albeit she (the robot) enjoys the thrill when it comes to murder. No one is off-limits, except the girl M3gan has to protect.
