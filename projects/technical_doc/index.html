        <header><h2>What is Data Analytics</h2></header>
        <p>
          Data Analytics is an art that focuses on providing and turning data into information. That is, it uses raw or random data and makes sense out of them. The process of the art involves collecting, cleaning, transforming, and sharing the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beautiful practice is used in all fields you can think of. It can be done by internal or external teams of companies and organisations, including non-profits. We all get information from data without realising it. The art is used in fields like:
          <ul>
            <li>Retail</li>
            <li>Academia</li>
            <li>Entertainment</li>
            <li>Healthcare</li>
            <li>Government</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          These are some examples where the art is used. The main reason for Data Analytics is to allow individuals to make informed decisions and apply problem solving mechanisms to eliminate issues and create new opportunities.

        <p>
          There four main types of analytics that can be used to provide meaning to data. They all offer a unique perspective to decision-makers. The types are summarized in the table below:

      <section class="main-section" id="Tools_Used">
        <header><h2>Tools Used</h2></header>

        <p>
          There are several tools such as software that can be used throughout the different processes of data analytics. The following tools are essential tools:
        </p>
        <h3>Data Storage</h3>
        <p>
          The data is often stored in sometype of database system like Postgre, MySQL, and Big Query. This is normally in the form of a data mart, data lake, or data warehouse depending on what the data is used for. Storage systems are typically set up and managed by <strong>Data Engineers</strong>; therefore, Data Analysts work in collaboration with different data professionals.
        </p>

        <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
        <p>
          The top three programming languages that are widely used are <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>R</strong>. SQL is a querying language used to interact with databases. Python is a powerful language that can be used in the field providing statistics, visualisation, and data cleaning, trnasforming, and storing. R, though powerful especially when dealing with statistics, it is mainly applied in academia.
        </p>

        <h3>Visualisations</h3>
        <p>
          There many visualisation tools that can be used to display and share information either through static images or dynamic dashboards. These include:
          <ul>
            <li>Seaborn and Matplotlib: Python libraries for visualisation</li>
            <li>ggplot: R library</li>
            <li>Tableau: Owned by Salesforce, allows you to create both statics and dynamic dashboards. Keep in mind there is a free-version and a paid version.</li>
            <li>Power BI: A Business Intelligence tool developed by Microsoft.</li>
            <li>Looker: A BI tool by Google.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Reporting</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes the findings of the Data Analyst need to be reported in a document. This document could be a pdf, powerpoint slideshow, or an Excel file.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following sections include the process of data analytics.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="What_is_the_Problem">
        <header><h2>What is the Problem</h2></header>
        <p>
          The first step is to understand the problem that needs to be solved. This step ensures that the correct data would be used to make decisions. It also involves communicating with different stakeholders and those that need the analysis performed, to be clear about what is needed to be done.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>NB:</strong> The following sections all use the Python language to explain the different stages in the process.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Collecting_the_Data">
        <header><h2>Collecting the Data</h2></header>
        <p>
          In Python, <strong>Pandas</strong> is a powerful library that is used throughout the process of data analysis. In the second step of the process, it can be used to import all types of data. The first step when using pandas is to import it to the python file:
          <pre class="import">
            <code>
              import pandas as pd
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are different file types that the data can be stored in such as, .csv, .txt, and .xslx. The library allows theses files to be collected and placed in a temporary <strong>DataFrame</strong> for further processing:
          <pre>
            <code>
              # .txt and .csv files use the same method
              csv_file = "sometext.csv"
              df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
            </code>
          </pre>
          <pre>
            <code>
              file = 'plants.xlsx'
              data = pd.ExcelFile(file)
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Another common practice is to import SQL data from a database. This data can be in real-time or periodic. It also aallows you to store data to the database. The additional library used is SQLAlchemy:
          <pre>
            <code>
              from sqlalchemy import    create_engine
              import pandas as pd

              engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Northwind.sqlite')
              connect = engine.connect()
              df = pd.read_sql_query('SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Value >= 150 ORDER BY Date', connect)
              connect.close()
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          These practices are assuming that the data has been already collected through surveys, questionnaires, and other mechanisms like data pipelines. One method to collect the data directly is to use webscraping:
          <pre>
            <code>
              from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
              import requests

              url = 'https://www.python.org/~guido/'
              req = requests.get(url)
              html = req.text
              soup = BeautifulSoup(html, features="html.parser")
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Cleaning_the_Data">
        <header><h2>Cleaning the Data</h2></header>
        <p>
          Now that the data has been collected and imported to the Python file, it is time to clean it. Data cleaning involves removing duplicates and other anomalies, and extracting the data that is needed from the data frame. The cleaning process is vast and agruably the best part of the entire process. You can fill in missing values, remove missing values, remove empty rows and columns and so much more. For example, let's say we have a shop data frame and we went to remove columns that do not meet the threshold:
          <pre>
            <code>
              # Create a threshold
              threshold = len(shop) * 0.05

              # List of columns to drop
              drop_cols = shops.columns[shops.isna().sum() <= threshold]

              # Remove the columns from the dataset
              shops.dropna(subet=drop_cols, inplace=True) 

            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Analysing_the_Data">
        <header><h2>Analysing the Data</h2></header>
        <p>
          Here you can apply summary statistics or use visualisations to analyse the data and extract what you need to make decisions. One common approach for numeric data is to group them by columns and find the mean or any other statistic:
          <pre>
            <code>
              # Find the mean
              mean_df = df.groupby(["Salary", "Age", "Experience"]).mean()
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Transformation">
        <header><h2>Data Transformation</h2></header>
        <p>
          The findings of the analysis can be formatted and send to different stakeholders or even back to a database for further processing. The format can be in the form of a csv file etc. This step can come after the visualisation step as well. It depends on the need and criteria of the data:
          <pre>
            <code>
              mean_df.to_csv("sport_data.csv", sep=';', index=False)
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Visualisation">
        <header><h2>Data Visualisation</h2></header>
        <p>
          This is one of the most powerful ways to share data so that users of it can see what is occuring with different variables. You need to decide which tool you are going to use and of the visuals will be static or dynamic. For dynamic dashboards you can you Tableau. Additionally, if the data are to be visualed through static images, then it can be done in Python. You can also incorporate all the static images into a single file or slide-show for reporting.
